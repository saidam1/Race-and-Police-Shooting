# Race-and-Police-Shootings

There has been a rising tension between African Americans, and Police these past few year. This year especially, with a lot recorded police brutality, in cases like Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Elijah McClain, and many more. The FBI had collected data from January 2015 until June 2020, and we used this data in order to see trends of rising Police Killings and the relation with race.

### Data

The data used in this study of the connection between Race and Police Shootings was obtained from [Washington post database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/).

The Washington Post had this data, showing the number of shootings across the country. It is mentioned that although based of the data they give, which is based on an FBI report, there are more White People killed by police, they also have the highest population. The argument is that Black People are being killed at a disproportional rate.

### Goals

The goal of this project is to find out the relationship between race and police shootings. 
[The Washington Post] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/) has shown this graph showing the increase of Police Shooting throught the years. We are trying to dig a little deeper than what this graph shows.

* We will check the increase of Police Shootings throught the years
   * Is the increase similar or different within different races?
* We will list the number of people that were killed by Police, distingusing them by race
* Finally we will look at the difference between Police Shoothing in White and Black Races in depth.
   * We will check the police killing per the race population
   * We will check whcih race is more likely to be killed while being unarmed
   * We will check in whcih race there are more younger people killed

### Methods

The methods that were used in order to do this project were mostly pandas and matplotlib.pyplot libraries from Python.
We used Python 3.0 via Anaconda.

### Results

## Trend of Police Shoothings throughout the years

## The total number of people killed from each race by police

This shows that the race with the highest number of people killed by police is White.

Here you can see why it was said at the beginning of this report that Black people are being killed at a disproportionate rate.

# Conclusion

The data we found showed that even though there are more White people killed in total, Black people are still the ones that are disproportionally killed. We have shown that the number of White people killed by police per million of thier population is 12.9, while it is 32.1 for Black people even though their population is significantly lower. 

Black people are also more likely to get shot while unarmed compared to a White person. Based of the data we have we have shown that out of the White people killed there were 5.7% that were killed unarmed and it was 9.4% for Black people.

Finally, the last test we did to see how much more Black people are affected is that we checked the amount of young people were killed in both races. Only 4.38% of White people were killed that were at the age of 20 or younger compared to a percentage of 11.66% of Black people.
